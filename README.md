CS:GO Jump Stats plugin for SourceMod

###Instalation

#####For Windows:
  1. Copy the `.sp file(s)` and the `include` folder into `\csgo\addons\sourcemod\scripting\`.
  2. Drag and drop the main .sp file, named `jumpstats.sp` in this case, on the `compiler.exe` file.
  3. If the compilation succeeds you will find the compiled file, named `jumpstats.smx` in this case, in the `compiled` folder.
  4. Copy the compiled plugin to `\csgo\addons\sourcemod\plugins\` and you are ready to go. If your server was already running you might have to restart it or change the map for the plugin to load.
  
#####For Linux and MacOS:
  * Something similar to the Windows procedure. You can probably figure it out.
